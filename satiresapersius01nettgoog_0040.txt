LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxxiii

worldly knowledge would have led him to correct his error of Judg·
ment, though the history of English authors show us, in at least one
instance, that of Ben Jo'nson‚ that a man, not only of true comio genius
but of large experiences of life, may be so enslaved by acquired learning
as to satirize vice and folly as he reads of them in his books, rather*
than as he sees them in society.

But time warns me that I must leave the yet unfinished list of the
influences which worked or may have worked upon Persius, and say a
few words upon his actual merits as a writer. The tendency of what
hasbeen advanced hitherto has been to make us think of him as more
passive than active-as a candidate more for our interest and our
sympathy than for our admiration. But we must not forget that it
is his own excellence that has made him a classic—that the great and
true glory which, as Quintilian sa s, he gained by a single volume, has
been due to that volume alone! If we would justify the award of his
contemporaries and of posterity, we may be prepared to account lor it.
It was not, as we have seen, that he was an originating power in philo·
sophy‚ or a many-sided observer of men and manners. He wasa
satirist, but he shows no knowledge of many of the ingredients which,
. as Juvenal rightly perceived, go to make up the satiric medley. He
was what in modern parlance would be called a plagiarist—at charge
which, later if not sooner, must have told fatally on an otherwise un-
supported reputation. I might add that he is frequently perplexed in
arrangement and habitually obscure in meaning, were it not that some
judges have professed to discover in this the secret of his farne. A ’
truer appreciation will,I believe, be more likely to lind it in the distinct
and individual character of his writings, the power of mind and depth
of feeling visible throughout, the austere purity of his moral tone, ,
relieved by frequent outbreaks of genial humour, and the condensed
vigour and graphio freshness of a style where elaborate art seems to be
only nature triumphing over obstacles. Probably no writer ever
borrowed so much and yet left on the mind so decided an impression
of originality.ssHis description of the wilful invalid and his medical
friend in the third satire owes much of its colouring to Horace, yet the
whole presentationis felt to be his own-true, pointed, and sufficient.
Even when the picture is entirely Horatian‚ like that of the over-
covetous man at his prayers, in the second satire, the effect is original
still, though the very varietics which discriminate it may be referred to
hints in other parts of Horace’s own works.‘ We may wish that he
had painted from his own observation and knowledge, but we cannot
deny that he has shown a painter's power. And where he drawa the
