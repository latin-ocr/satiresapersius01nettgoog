xxx LECTURE ΟΝ THE

Scipio and Laelius, though a mere boy, and himself of equestrian rank,
he attacked great consular personages who had opposed his friends:
as Horace phrases it, he tore away the vell from private life and
arraigned high and low silke-showing no favour but to virtue and the
virtuous—words generally found to bear a tolerably p'r'e‘cise'iii‘e'a‘n'r‘rsg
in the vocabulary of politics. It was the satire of the republic, or
. rather of the old oligarchy, and it was impossible that it could live on
unchanged into the times of the Empire. But the memory of its day
of freedom was not forgotten: the ancient right of impeachment was
claimed formally by men who intended no more than a common
criminal information; and each succeeding satirist sheltered himself

ostentatiously under an example of which he knew better than to ·

attempt to avail himself ln practice.

lt was to Lucilius, as we have already seen, that Persius, if reliance
is to be placed on the statement of his biographer, owed the impulse
that made him a writer of satire. Of the actual work which is related
to have produced so remarkable an effect on its young reader, the
tenth book, scarcely anything has been preserved; while the remains
of the fourth, which is said to have been the model of Persius’ third
satire, comparatively copious and interesting as they are, contain no·
thing which would enable us to judge for ourselves of the degree of
resemblance. Hardly a single parallel from Lucilius is quoted hythe
Scholia on any part of Persius: but when we consider that the ag-
gregate of their citations from Horace, though much larger, is utterly
inadequate to express the obligations which are everywhere obvious to
the eye of a modern scholar, we cannot take their omissions as evena
presumptive proof that what is not apparent does not exist. On the
other hand, the Prologue¹ to the Satires, in scazon iambica, is supposed,
on the authority of an obscure passage in Petronius, to have had its
prototype in a similar composition by Lucilius ; and it is also a plau·
sible conjecture that the first lineos the first satire is taken bodily from
the old poet—two distinct proclamations ol adhesion at the very outset,
in the ears of those who could not fail to understand them. There is
reason, also, for believing that the imitation may have extended further,
and that Persius’ strictures on the poets of his day, and in particular
on those who affected a taste for archaisms, and professed to read the
old Roman drama with delight, may have been studied after those
irreverent criticisms of the fathers of poetry, some of which, as the
Scholiasta on Horace inform us, occurred in this very tenth book of
