SAT. 1. 7

‘We shut ourselves up and write, one verse, and another prose,
all in the grand style to be panted forth by the lungs with a vast
expenditure of breath. Yes-you hope to read this out some day,
got up sprucely with a new toga, all in white with your birthday
ring on at last, perched up on a high seat, aiter gargling your
supple throat by a liquid process of tuning, with a languishing
roll of your wanton eye. At this you may see' great brawny sons

two, one of the trtb century, have
‘legens’ and a considerable majority
‘ colluerit.’ Jahn remarks that the and

‘legens' and ‘colluerit ’ be adopted, a
comma must be put aiter ‘ ocello?
