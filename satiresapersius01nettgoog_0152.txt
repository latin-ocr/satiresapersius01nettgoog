SAT. V. 105

ίΑιιιιιιι, then, but drop that angry wrinkled snarl frorn your
nostrils, while 1 pull your old grandmother out of the heart of you.
It was not in the praetor's province to give fools command over
the delicate proprieties of relative duty, or grant them the entry of
the rapid racc-course of life ; you will get a hulking campfollower
to handle a dulcimer first. No, reason steps in your way and
whispers privately in your ear that· no one be allowed to do what
he will spoil in the doing. It is a statute contained in the general
code of humanity and nature, that ignorance and imbecility operate
as an ernbargo on a forbidden action. What? compound helle·
bore, when you don’t know the right point at which to steady the
index of the steel·yard? The law of the healing art forbids you.

cd. remarks.
natura seems ιο be mentioned as
the source of the law, which rs conse·
quently accepted and adrnowledg ed
everywhere. [The doctrine of a supreme
law of Nature, the actual source and
ideal standard of all particular laws,
was characteristic of the Stoics, and
was the basis of the Roman juristical
notion of a ‘ratio naturalis* (inst. ι. 1).

The nse of antus in this sense
seems chiefly to belong to later Latin.

[But ‘pravitatibus’ seems there to be
