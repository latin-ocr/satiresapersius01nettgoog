LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxv

depends on the truth of the reading given in the MSS. The fourth
satire does undoubtedly touch on statesmanship: but the tone through-
out is that of astudent, who in his eagemess to imitate Plato has
apparently forgotten that he is himself living not under a popular but
under an imperial government, and the moral intended to be conveyed
is simply that the adviser of the public ought to possess some better
qualification than those which were found in Alcibiades—a topic about
as appropriate to the actual state of Rome as the schoolboy’s exhorta-
tion to Sulla to lay down his power. Thus his language, where he
does spenlr, enables us to interpret his silence as the silence not of
acquiescence or even of timidity, though such times as his might well
justify caution, but rather of unworldly innocence, satisfied with its
own aspirations after moral perfection, and dreaming of Athenian
licence under the very shade of despotism. On the other hand, it is
perfectly intelligible that he should have seen little to admire in
Seneca, many as are the coincidences which their common philosophy
has produced in their respective writings. There could, indeed, have
been but little sympathy between his simple earnestness and that
- rhetorical facility-that Spanish taste for inappropriate and mere·
tricious ornament-that tolerant and compromising temper, able to
. live in a court while unable to live in exile, which, however compatible
with real wisdom and virtue, must have seemed to a Stoic ol a severer
type only so many qualifications for effectually betraying the good
cause. So, again, he does not seem to exhibit any anticipation of the
distinctly human and religious development which, as we have seen,
was the final phase of Stoicism. His piety is simply the rational piety
which would approve itself to any Roman moralist-the piety recom-
mended by Horace, and afterwards by Juvenal-pronouncing purity
of intent to be more acceptable in the sight of Heaven than costly
sacrifice, and bidding men ask of the gods such things only as divine
beings would wish to grant. In like manner his humanity, though
genial in its practical aspect, is still narrowed on the speculative side
by the old sectarian exclusiveness which barred the path of life to
every one not entering through the gate of philosophy. In short, he
is adisciple of the earlier Stoicism of the empire-a Roman in his
predilection for the ethical part of his creed, yet conforming in other

respects to the primitive traditions of Greece—neither a patriot nor a
courtier, but a recluse student, an ardent teacher of the truths which he
had himself learnt, without the development which might have been
generated by more mature thought, or the abatement which might
have been forced upon him by a longer experience.
