LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxiii

the enieebled yet resisting rivals, and the victorious advances of a
new and living saith.

Itis not often that a poet has been so completely identified with a
system oi philosophy as Persius. Greece had produced poets who
were philosophers, and philosophers who were writers of poetry; yet
our first thought os Aeschylus is not as ol a Pythagoream or ol
Euripides as oi a iollower of the Sophists; nor should we classiiy
Xenophanes or Empedocles primarily as poets ol whose writings only
fragments remain. In Lucretius and Persius, on the other handive
see men who hold a prominent place among the poets of their country,
yet whose poetry is devoted to the eniorcement of their peculiar philo-
sophical views. The fact is a significant one, and symptomatic of that
condition of Roman culture which Ι have noticed on aiormer occasion.
It points to an age and nation where philosophy is a permanent, not
a progressive study-an imported commodity, not an indigenous
growth,—where the impulse that gives rise to poetry is not so much
a desire to give musical voice to the native thought and feeling of the
poet and his follow-men, as a recognition oi the wantos a national
literature and a wish to contribute towards its supply. At first sight
there may seem something extravagant in pretending that Persius can
be called the poet oi Stoicism in the sense in which Lucretius is the
poet ol Epicureanism, as il there were equal scope lor the exposition
oi a philosophy in a few scholastic exercises and in an elaborate
didactic poem. On the other hand it should be recollected that
under the iron grasp ol the Roman mind, Stoicism, as was just now
remarked, was being reduced more and more to a simply practical
system, bearing but a faint impress of those abstruse cosmological
speculations which had so great a charm sor the intellectos Greece
even in its most sober momenta and exhibiting in place os theman
applicability to civil life the want ol which had been noted as a defect
in the conceptions of Zeno and Chrysippus ¹. The library and the
lecture-room still were more familiar to it than the forum or the

senate ; but the transition had begun: and though Persius may have
looked to his seven hundred volumes sor his principles of action, as he
did to Horace lor information about the ways ol the world, the only
theory which he strove to inculcate was the knowledge which the

founders os his sect, in common with Socrates, believed to be the sole
groundworlr of correct practice. Using the very words os Virgil, he
calls upon abenighted race to acquaint itseli with the causes ol things:
