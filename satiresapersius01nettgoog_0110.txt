asunder from all points oi the compass? Have you any goal? any
mark at which you aim? or are you on a vague wild-goose chase
armed with broken pots and mud‚ not caring where you gc, and ·
living by the rule oi the moment?

It is too late to ask for hellebcre‚ as you see men doing, when
the skin is just getting morbid and bloated. Meet the disease at
its first stage, and what occasion is there to promise Craterus
gold-mines ior a cure? Be instructed, poor creatureS, and ac·
quaint yourselves with the causes of things—what we are, what life
we are sent into the world to lead, what is the rank assigned us
at starting, where is the smooth turn round the goal and when to

magnos promittere montis, a
proverbial phrase. Jahn compares Ter.
Phorm. 68 ‘modo nou montes auri pol-
licens,' Heius, Sall. Cat. 23 ‘maria
montesque polliceri coepit‚’ from which
it appears that the expression was va·
riously understood, some taking it cf
mountains ol gold, others of actual
mountains. [Comp. Plautus Stich. 25
‘Persarum Montes qui esse aurei perhi-
benturz’ ‘argenti montes' it. Mil. 1065:
and Varro Sat. Menipp. p. 103 Riese]
‘ch will not then be driven to the
frantie offers which patients in despera-
tion make to their physicians.’

thatin Hor. 3 Od. 14. 11 ‘male orni·
natis Parcite verbis,' if the reading is
correct. [Πότε δὲ (ἀπολαύσεις) τῆς’έφ’

causas cognoscite rerum is
doubtless from Virg. G. 2. 490; but
Virgil means the physical causes of na-
ture; Persius the final cause of human
lite, Juvenal‘s ‘vivendi causas' (8. 84l.

67. sumus, etc. The questions,
though really dependent, are put in
au independent form, except ‘deceat‘
v. 71. Compare Prop. 3. 5. 25 t'cll.
The questions here proposed are Stoic

et percontabere doctos, Qua ratione
queas traducere leniter aevum‚’ etc.

quid sumus. Cic. Fin. 4. 10,
speaking cf the points on which Stoics
and Academica agree. ‘Sequitur illud ut
animadvertamus qui simus ipsi. . . Su·
musigiturhomines : ex animo constamus
et corpore, quae sunt cuiusdam modi ;'
from which he goes on to deduce the
end of lise, ‘secundum naturam vivere,'
so as to illustrate Persius’ second inquiry.

οἶδεν ὅστις έστίν οὐδὲ τί έστι κόσμος.

quidnam = ‘ quam vitam!

victuri, not expressing time but
purpose. See note on 1. too. .

ordo seems ri htly explained by
Heius. aud Jahn witlr reference to what
