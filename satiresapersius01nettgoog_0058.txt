‘Listen The sons of Rome are sitting after a full meal and
enquiring in their cups, What news from the divine world of
poesy? Hereupon a personage with ahyacinth-coloured mantle
over his shoulders brings out some mawkish trash or other with
a snuffle and a lisp, something about Phyllises or Hypsipyles,
or any of the many heroines over whom poets have snivelled‚
filtering out his tones, and tripping up the words against the roof
of his delicate mouth. The heroes have expressed approval—now
is not the poet happy in his gravei Now does not the stone press
on his bones more lightlyi The humbler guests follow with their
appianae-now will not a crop of violets spring up from those
remains of his-from the sod of his tomb, and from the ashes so
highly blesti’

natural extension of the metaphor which
