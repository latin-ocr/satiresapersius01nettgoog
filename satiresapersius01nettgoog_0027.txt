himself worthy ol his pupil’s liberality by relinquishing the money
and accepting the books only. He also undertook the office ol
reviewing his works, recommending that the juvenile productioris
should be destroyed, and preparing the Satires for publication by
a lew slight corrections and the omission ol some lines at the end,
which seemed to leave the work imperfect—perhaps, as Jahn supposes,
the fragment of a new satire. They were ultimately edited by Caesius
Bassus, at his own request, and acquired instantaueous popularity.
The memoir goes on to tell us that Persius was beautiful in person,
gentle in manners, a man ol maidenly modesty, an excellent son,
brother, and nephew, os hugal and moderate habits. This is all that
we know of his life-enough to give the personal interest which
a reader os his writings will naturally require, and enough, too, to
surnish a bright page to a history where bright pages are few.
Persius was a Roman, but the only Rome that he knew by experience
was the Rome of Tiberius Caligula, Claudius, and Nero—the Rome
which Tacitus and Suetonius have pourtrayed‚ and which pointed
St. Paul's denunciation ol the moral state of the heathen world.
Stoicism was not regnant but militant-it produced not heroes or
statesmen, but confessors and martyrs3 and the early death which cut
short the promise of its Marcellus could notin such an age be called
unseasonable.

, It was about two hundred years since a Stoie first appeared in
Rome as a member ol the philosophie embassy which Athens de-
spatched to propitiate the conquering city. Like his companions, he
was bidden to go back to his school and lecture there, leaving the youth
of Rome to receive their education, as heretofore‚ from the magistrates
and the laws ; but though the rigidity ol the elder Cato triumphed for
a time, it was not sufficient effectually to exorcise the new spirit.
Panaetius, under whose influence the soul of Stoicism became more
humane and its form more gracesul, gained the friendship of Laelius,
· and through him of Scipio Aemilianus, whom he accompanied on the
mission which the conqueror of Carthage unde'rtook to the kings ol
Egypt and Asia in alliance with the republic. The loreign philosophy
was next admitted to mould the most characteristic os all the produc·
tions ol the Roman mind—its jurisprudence, being embraced by a long
line of illustrious legista ; and the relative duties of civil life were
defined and limited by conceptions borrowed from Stoic morality. It
was indeed a doctrine which, as soon as the national prejudice against
importcd novelties and a systematic cultivation had been surmounted,
was sure to prove itsell congeuial to the strictness and practicality os the
