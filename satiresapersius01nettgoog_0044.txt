THE TEXT OF PERSIUS¹

..40-

[To judge from the praise bestowed upon him by Quintilian and
Martial², and from the numerous quotations made from him by the
grammarians, Persius must have had a considerable number oi readers
in the first four centuries alter Christ. The palimpsest ol Bobbio⁸
(now No. 5750 in the Vatican Library), a fragment of which still
exists, must have belonged to this carly period.

ln nn. 402 Flavius Julius Trylonianus Sabinus, a young man of
high rank, attempted, as he tells us in a subscriptio now preserved at
the end os the two best manuscripts, to correct the text ol Persius:
‘Flavius Julius Tryfonianus Sabinus, v.c., protector domesticus,
temptavi emendare sine antigrapho meum et adnotavi Barcellone‚ coss.
dd. nn. Arcadio et Honorio V.' It is important to observe that in the
Latin of this period, ‘emendare’ implies not conJ'ectural emendation
as we understand it, but bare correction of such obvious errors as
abounded in most manuscripts, even the oldest, at that time. ‘Adno-
tatio' probably means the insertion of critical and explanatory notes,
The corrector generally made use of another copy l‘antigraphon')
with which to compare his own; but Sabinus is carelul to tell us that
his work was performed without one.

At the time of the Carolingian revival, and during the succeeding
centuries, many copies of Persius were made, and many still exist.
From these Jahn, who gave the readings of a great number in 1843,
selected three as the basis of his text of 1868. The three are, (ι) Νο.
