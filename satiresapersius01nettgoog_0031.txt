xxiv LECTURE ΟΝ THE

>l Ι but the invitation is not to that study of the stars in their courses, of
eclipses, and earthquakes and inundatione, of the laws governing the
length of days and nights, which enabled Lucretius to triumph over
the fear of death, but to an inquiry into the purpose of man's being,
the art of slrilful driving in the chariot-race of life, the limits to a desire
of wealth and to its expenditure on unselfish objects, and the ordained
position of each individual in the social system. Such an apprehension
of his subject would naturally lead him not to the treatise, but to the
sermon—not to the didactic poem, but to the satire or moral epistle.
But though the form of the composition is desultory, the spirit is in the
main definite and consistent. Even in the firmae-tire, in which he
seems to drop the philosopher and assume the critic we recognize the
same belief in the connection between intellectual knowledge and
practice, and consequently between a corrupt taste and a relaxed
morality, which shines out so clearly afterwards when he tells the
enfranchised slave that he cannot move a finger without committing ’
ablunder, and that it is as portentous for a man to take part in life
without study as it would be for a ploughman to attempt to bring a
ship into port. It is true that he follows Horace closely, not only in
his illustrations and descriptions of manners, but in his lessons of
morality-a strange deference to the man who ridiculed Crispinus and
Damasippus and did not even spare the great Stertinius ; but the evil
and folly of avarice, the wisdom of contentment and seit-control, and
the duty of sincerity towards man and God, were doctrines at least as
congenial to a Stoic as to an Epicurean, and the ambition with which
the pupil is continually seelcing to improve upon his master's felicity
of expression shows itself more successfully in endeavours to give
greater stringency to his rule of life and conduct. In one respect,
certainly, we may wonder that he has failed to represent the views of
that section of the Stoics with which he is reported to have lived on
terms of familiar intercourse. There is no trace of that political feeling
which might have been expected to appear in the writings of a youth
who was brought into frequent contact with the revolutionary enthu-
siasm of Lucan, and may probably have been present at one of the
banquets with which Thrasea and Helvidius used to celebrate the
birthdays of the first and the last of the great republican worthies,
The supposed allusions to the poetical character of Nero in the first
satire shrink almost to nothing in the light of a searching criticism, while
the tradition that in the original draught the emperor was directly
satirized as Midas receives no countenance, to say the least, from the
poem itself, the very point of which, sofar as we can apprehend it,
