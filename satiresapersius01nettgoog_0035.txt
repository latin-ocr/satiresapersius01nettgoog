suited to her direct practical genius, and to her mastery over the arts
oi social lile. There can be no question but that the conception of
seizing the spirit ol comedy—of the new comedy no less than theold
-the comedy ol manners as well as the comcdy ol scurrilous bur·
lesque—and investing it with an easy undress clothing, the texture ol
which might be varied as the inward feeling changed, was a great
advance in the progress ol letters. It would seem to be a test ol the
lawlul development ol a new form ol composition srom an old, that the
latter should be capable ol including the earlier, as the larger includes
the smaller. So in the development ol the Shaksperian drama from
the Greek, the chorus is not lost either as a lyrical or as an ethical
element, but is diffused over the play, no longer seen indeed, but felt
in the art which heightens the tone of poetry, and brings out the moral
relations ol the characters into more prominent relies. So in that
, great development which transcends as it embraces all others, the
development ol prose from poetry, the superiority of the new form to
the old as a general vehicle of expression is shown in the expansive
flexibility which can find measured and rhythmic utterance for the
raptures of passion or imagination, yet give no undue elevation to the
J statement ol the plainest matters ol lact. And so it is in the genera·
tion of satire from comedy: the unwieldy framework of the drama is
gone, but the dramatic power remains, and may be summoned up at
any time at the pleasure ol the poet, not only in the impalpable shape
ol remarks on human character, but in the flesh-and-blood lulness ol

’ actual dialogue such as engrosses several of the satires ol Horace, and
enters as a more or less important ingredient into every one of those
of Persius. Or, if we choose to regard satire, as we are fully warranted
in doing, in its relation not only to the stage but to other kinds ol
poetry, we shall have equal reason to admire it lor its elasticity‚ as
being capable of rising without any ungracelul effort lrom light ridi·
cule to heightened eamestness-passing at once with Horace from a

Ι ludicrous description ol a poet as a marked man, to an emphatic
recognition of his essentia] greatness3 or with Juvenal lrom a sneer at
the contemptible offerings with which the gods were commonly pro-

pitiated, to a sublime recital of the blessings which may lawfully be
made objects of prayer. This plastic comprehensiveness was realized
by the earlier writers, as we have scen, by means of the variety of their
metres, while the latter were enabled to compass it more artistically by
that skillul management of the hexameter which could not be brought
to perfectiori in a day. But the conception appears to have been
radically the same throughout; and the very name satura already con·
