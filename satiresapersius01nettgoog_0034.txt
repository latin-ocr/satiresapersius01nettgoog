LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxvii

much, coupled 'with the fact that in one of them Life and Death were
introduced contending with each other as two allegorica] personages,
like Fame in Virgil, as Quintilian remarks, or Virtue and Pleasure in
the moral tale of Prodicus. Little as this is, it is more than is known
of the satires of Pacuvius of which we only hear that they resembled
those of Ennius. What was the precise relation borne by either to the
later Roman satire with which we are so familiar can but be conjec-
tured. Horace, who is followed as usual by Persius, ignores them both
as satirists and claims the patemity of satire for Lucilius, who, as he
sayS, imitated the old Attic comedy, changing merely the measure;
nor does Quintilian mention them in the briei but celebrated passage
in which he asserts the merit of the invention of satire to belong wholly
to Rome. This silence may be taken as showing that neither Ennius
nor Pacuvius gave any exclusive or decided prominence to that element
of satire which in modern times has become its distinguishing character-
istic-criticism on the men, manners, and things of the day ; but it can
scarcely impeach their credit as the first founders of a new and⁴ original
school of composition. That which constitutes the vaunted originality
of Roman satire is not so much its substance as its form: the one had
already existed in perfectiori at Athens, the elaboration of the other
was reserved for the poetic art of Italy. It is certainly not a little
remarkable that the countrymen of Aristophanes and Menander should
not have risen to the full conception of familiar compositions in verse
in which the poet pours out desultory thoughts on contemporary sub-
jects in his own person, relieved from the trammels which necessarily
bind every dramatic productim, however free and unbridled its spirit.
That such a thing might easily have arisen among them is evident
from the traditional fame of the Homeric Margites, itself apparently
combining one of the actual requisites of the Roman medley‚ the mix·
ture of metres, with the biting invective of the later satire-a work
which, when fixed at its latest date, must have been one of the con-
comitants, if not, as Aristotle thinks, the veritable parent, of the earlier
comedy of Greece. In later times we find parallels to Roman satire
in some of the idylls of Theocritus, not ohly in those light dialogues
noticed by the critics, of which the Adoniazusae is the best instance,
but in the poem entitled the Charites, where the poet complains of the
general neglect into which his art has fallen in a strain of mingled
pathos and sarcasm which may remind us ofJuvenal's appeal in behalf ’
of men of letters, the unfortunate fraternity of authors. But Greece
was not ordained to excel in everything3 and Rome had the oppor-
tunity of cultivating a virtually unbroken field of labour which was
