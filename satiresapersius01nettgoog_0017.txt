first sight easy to decide whether the reading is in mores or tn·
mores. As regards orthography, this MS. is much freer from
mistakes than the MS. of Juvenal bound in the same cover
and apparently written by the same hand, in the tenth satire
of which 1 found such misspellings as gretia for Graecia,
canicies for canities, contentas for concentus, sotio for socio, and
thomatnla for tomacula. This confusion between c and tis
almost unknown to the MS. of Persius: patritiae (Sat. 6. 73)
being perhaps the only instance of it. In Sat.1.116,how-
ever, it is difficolt to make out whether tbe scribe has written
rrrrrti or muci. The chief confusions of consonants which this
MS. exhibits are between b and p (obtare for optare, rapiosa
for rabiosa): between g and gn (pr'agne impinge, longnos for
longos) : between sand ss (arrrmims, asigna: cassiam, recusso

for casiam, recnso, etc.) : between m and rrrrrz, p and pp, e and

cc (imitere for immittere, ammomis for anrorrns, suppellex for

supellex, quipe for qnippe, peccori for pecori, etc). Among the
vowels, a and o are occasionally confused, as eerrtnriarmna
Salonas for centurionum, Solones: so with o and a (samma,
frcrtnnare for famosa, fortunare ,· sopirms, conditor for sepinas,
conditnr): to say nothing of the interchange, common in such
MSS, of mande, yand i. The monosyllabic prepositions
are almost invariably joined with their nouns (etnmrclo, in·
laram, etc.) and sometimes even assimilated, The same is
often the case with monosyllabic conjunctions (carmarita, non·

cocta, sr'vocet, etc). ln words compounded with in, the prepo-

' sition is sometimes assimilated, sometimes not3 thus we find

inprimit, inprobe, conpossr'tnm by the side of implerunt, impulit,
compossitos. aa, on the other hand, is generally assimilated:

arradens, afficere, assit, etc.
‘It is doubtful,’ says Mr. Conington, ‘whether this MS. was
