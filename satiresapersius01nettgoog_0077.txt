30 PERSII

iratum Eupolidem praegrandi cum sene palles,

aspice et haec, si forte aliquid decoctius audis. 125
inde vaporata lector mihi ferveat aure:

non hic, qui in crepidas Graiorum ludere gestit

sordidus, et lusco qui possit dicere ‘lusce,'

fregerit eminas Arreti aedilis iniquas;

nec qui abaco numeros et secto in pulvere metas

scit risisse vafer, multum gaudere paratus,

si cynico barbam petulans nonaria vellat.
