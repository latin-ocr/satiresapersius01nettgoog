LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxix

tains a prophecy of the distinctive value of Roman satire as a point in
the history of letters. -

“ If, however, the praise of having originated satire cannot be refused
to Ennius, it must be confessed as freely that the influence exercised
· over it by Lucilius entitles him to be called its second father. It
belongs to one by the ties of birth-to the other by those of adoption
and education. Unlike Ennius, the glories of whose invention may ,
well have paled before his fame as the Roman Homer and the Roman
Euripides Lucilius seems to have devoted himself wholly to fostering
the growth and forming the mind of the satiric muse. He is thought =
to have so far departed from the· form of the old medley as to enforce
a uniformity of mette in each separate satire, though even this is not '
certainly made out; buthe preserved the externa] variety by writing
sometimes in hexameter, sometimes iu iambica or trochaics, and also
by a practice, seemingly peculiar to himself, of mixing Latin copiously
with Greek, the language corresponding to French in the polite circles
of Rome. It is evident‚ ton, both from his numerous fragments and
from the notices of the early grammarians, that he encouraged to a
large extent the satiric tendency to diversity of subject-at one moment
soaring on the wing of epic poetry and describiug a council of the
gods in language which Virgil has copied, the next satirizing the fashion
of giving fine Greek names to articles of domestic furniture,-compre-
hending in the same satire a description of a journey from Rome to
Capua, and a series of strictures on his predecessors in poetry, whom
he seems to have corrected like so many school-boys5—now laying
down the law about the niceties of grammar, showing how the second
conjugation is to be discriminated from the third, and the genitive
singular from the nominative plural; and now talking, possibly within
a few lines, of seizing an antagonist by the nose, dashing his fist in his
face, and knocking out every tooth in his head. But his great achieve·
ment, as attested by the impression left on the minds of his Roman
readers, was that of making satire henceforward synonymous with free
speaking and personality-he comes before us as the reviver of the
Fescennine licence, the imitator of Cratinus and Eupolis and Aristo·
phanes. There seems to have been about him a reckless animal
κ pugnacity, an exhilarating consciousness of his powers as a good hater,
which in its rude simplicity may remind us of Archilochus, and cer-

tainly is but faintly represented in the arch pleasantry of Horace, the .

concentrated intellectual scorn of Persius, or of the declamatory indig-
nation of Juvenal. Living in a period of politica] excitement, he
plunged eagerly into party quarrels. The companiou of the younger
