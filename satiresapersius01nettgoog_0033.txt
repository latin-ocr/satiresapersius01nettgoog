xxvi LECTURE ΟΝ THE

We have already observed that the character ol Persius' opinions
determined his choice os a poetical vehicle for expressing them. With
his views it would have been as unnatural sor him to have composed
a didactic treatise, like Lucretius, ora republican epic, like Lucan, as
to have rested satisfied with multiplying the productions of his own boy-
hood, tragedies and pilgrimages inverse. And now, what was the
nature and what the historical antecedents ol that lorrn ol composition
which he adopted as most congenial to him?

The exploded derivation ol satire from the Greek satyric drama is
one os those infrequent instances where a false etymology has pre-
serveda significant truth. There seems every reason to believe that
the first beginnings os satire among the Romans are parallel to the
rudimental type from which dramatic entertainments were developed
in Greece. ‘When I am reading on these two subjects,' says Dryden‚
in his admirable essay on satire, ‘methinks 1 hear the same story told
twice over with very little alteration! The primitive Dionysiae festivals
ol the Greek rustic populations seem to have answered with sufficient
exactness to the harvest-home rejoicings ol agricultural Italy described
by Horace, when the country wits encountered each other in Fescennine
verses. Nor did the resemblance cease at this its earliest stage. Im· ,
provised repartee was succeeded by pantomimic representation and
dancing to music, andin process ol time the two elementa combined
yet discriminated from each other, assumed the form of a regular play,
with its alternate dialogues and cantz'ca. Previous to this later develop-
ment there had been an intermediate kind ol entertainment called
the satura or medley, either lrom the miscellaneous character ol its
matter, which appears to have made no pretence to a plot or story,
or lrom the variety ol measures of which it was composed-a more
professional and artistic exhibition than the Fescennine bantering·
matches, but far removed from the organized completeness ol even the
earlier drama. It was on this narrow ground that the independence of
the Roman genius was destined to assert itself. Whether from a wish
to take advantage of the name, or to preserve a thing, once popular,
from altogether dying out in the process of improvement, a feeling
which we know to have operated in the case of the exodia or interludes
introduced into the representation ol the Atellane plays, Ennius was
led to produce certain compositions which he called satirea seemingly
as various both in character and in versification as the old dramatic

medley, but intended not for acting but lor reciting or reading-in
other words, not plays but poems. All that we know ol these is com·
prised in a lew titles and a very few fragments, none os which tell us
