LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xix

being the only one of his generation whom Quintilian could think ol
including with Horace in the class of Roman lyrists-and Calpurnius
Statura, whose very name is a matter of uncertainty. He was also
intimate with Servilius Nonianus, who would seem from an incidental
notice to have been at one time his preceptor-a man ol consular
dignity‚ distinguished, as Tacitus informs us, not merely by high
reputation as an orator and an historian, but by the polished elegance
ol his lif. His connection with Cornutus, who was probably a
freedman of the Annaeau family, introduced him to Lucan; and
dissimilar as their temperaments were, the young Spaniard did ample
justice to the genius of his friend, scarcely restraining himself from
clamorous expressions of rapture when he heard him recite his verses.
At a later period Persius made the acquaintance of Seneca, but did
not admire him. Two other persons, who had been fellow·students
with him under Cornutus, are mentioned as men of great learning and
unblemished life, and zealous in the pursuit of philosophy—Claudius
Agathemerus of Lacedaemon, known as a physician of some name,
and Petronius Aristocrates of Magnesia. Such were his occupations,
and such the men with whom he lived. The sixth satire gives us
some information about his habits of life, though not more than we
might have been entitled to infer from our knowledge of his worldly
circumstances and of the custom of the Romans of his day. We see
him there retired from Rome for the winter to a retreat on the bay of
Luna, where his mother seems to have lived since her second marriage,
and indulging in recollections of Ennius’ formal announcement of the
beauties of the scene, while realizing in his own person the lessons of
content and tranquillity, which he had learned from the Epicureanism
of Horace no less than from the Stoicism of his philosophical teachers.
This may probably have been his last work—written, as some have
thought from internal evidence, under the consciousness that he had
not long to live, though we must not press the language about his
heir, in the face of what we are told of his actual testamentary dis-
positions. The details of his death state that it took place on the
a4th of November, nu. 62, towards the·end of his twenty-eighth year,
ofa disease oi the stomach, on an estate of his own eight miles from
Rom'e, on the Appian road. His whole fortune, amounting to two
million sesterces, he left to his mother and sister, with a request that
a sum, variously stated at a hundred thousand sesterces, and twenty
pounds weight of silver‚ might be given to his old preceptor, together
with his library, seven hundred volumes, chiefly, it would seem, works
of Chrysippus, who was a most voluminous writer. Cornutus showed
