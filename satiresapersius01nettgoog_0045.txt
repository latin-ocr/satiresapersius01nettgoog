xxxviii THE TEXT OF PERSIUS.

and (Β) are assigned to the tenth and the nlnth centuries respectively.
(3) No. ¹25 in the Library of the Medical School at Montpellier (C).
This manuscript, which is assigned to the ninth century, once belonged
to Pierre Pithon, and contains also the celebrated pithoeanus of Juvenal.
It was again collated by Rudolf Beer in 1885. The two first MSS„ (A)
and (Β), are evidently copied directly from one lost original (a), while
(C) represents a different recension. Jahn and Bdcheler give, I think
rightly, a general preference to (τὴς but their decision has been recently
impugned ln some points by Dr. J. Bieger, whose essay I have rnen·
tioned in the Preface to the Third Edition.

Each of these three manuscripts has been corrected by a second
hand, which is indicated by the letters (a), (b), and (c) respectively.
The other manuscripts are indicated by the letter r.

The variants of the Bobbio palimpsest‚ the fragment of which con-
tains only vv. 53-104 of the first satire, I have given with all possible
minuteness. I have also added a few references to the grammarians
which are not to be found in Bttcheler’s edition.

A glauce at the apparatus creticus will show how seriously the text
of Persius had been corrupted before it was copied anew in the
Carolingian era. H. N.]
