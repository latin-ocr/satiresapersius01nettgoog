life that he must have known, not from the descriptione of a past age
but from his own experience, his portraits have an imaginative truth,
minutely accurate yet highly ideal, which would entitle them to a dis-

tinguished place in any poetical gallery. There is nothing in Horace
or Juvenal more striking than the early part of the third satire, where
the youthful idler is at first represented bya series of light toucheS,
snoring in broad noon while the harvest is baking in the fields and the
cattle reposing in the shade, then startirrg up and calling sor his books
only to quarrel with them-and afterwards as we go further the scene
darkens, and we see the figure of the lost profligate blotting the back·
ground, and catch an intimation of yet more fearful punishments in
store for those who will not be warned in time-punishments dire as
any that the oppressors of mankind have suffered or devised—the be·
holding of virtue in her beauty when too late, and the consciousness of
acorroding secret which no other heart can share. Nor would it be
easy to parallel the effect of the sketches in the first satire, rapidly
succeeding each othon—the holiday poet with his white dress and his
onyx ring tuning his voice for recitation; a grey and bloated old man,
giving himself up to cater for the itching ears of others3 the jaded,
worn company at the table, languidly rousing themselves in the hope
of some new excitament; the inferior guests at the bottom of the hall
ready to applaud when they have got the cue from their betters-all
flung into a startllng and ghastly light by the recollection carefully
presented to us that these men call themselves the sons of the old
Romans, and recognise poetry as a divine thing, and acknowledge the
object 0f criticism to be truth. Again we see the same pictorial skill
and reality, though in a very different style, toned down and sobered‚
in those most sweet and touching lines describing the poet’s residence
with his beloved teacher, when they used to study together through
long summer suns aud seiae on the first and best hours of the night for
the social meal, each working while the other worked and resttng while
the other rested, and both looking forward to the modest enJ'oyment of
the evening as the crown of a well-spent day. Persius' language has
been censured for its harshness and exaggeration: but here, at any
rate, he is as simple and unaffected as an admirer of Horace or Virgil
could desire. The eontrast is instructive, and may perhaps suggesta
more favourable view of those peculiarities of expression which are
generally condemned. The style which his taste leads him to drop
when he is not writing satire, is the style which his taste leads him to
assume for satiric purposes. He feels that a clear, straightforward‚
everyday manner of speech would not suit a subject over which the
