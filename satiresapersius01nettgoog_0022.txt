Ιτ is my intention for the present to deliver general lectures from time
to time on the characteristics of some of the authors whom I may
select as subjects for my termina] courses. To those who propose to
attend my classes they will serve as prolegomena, grouping together
various matters which will meet trs afterwards as they lie scattered up
and down the course of our expository readings, and giving the point
ol view from which they are to be regarded: to others I trust they may
not be without their use as Sketches' Historical and Literary, complete
in themselves in which an attempt will be made to bring out the
various features and circumstances of each atrthor into a broad general
light, and exhibit the interest which they possess when considered
independently of critical minutiae.

The writer of whom Ι arn to spealr to·day is one who, as it seems
to me, supplies ample materials both for detailed study and lor a more
transient survey. It is a very superficial criticism which would pretend
that the reputation of Persius is owing simply to the labour which has
been spent upon him: still, where the excellence of an author is un-
doubted, the difficulties of his thought or his language are only so
many additional reasons why the patient and prolonged study of him
is sure to be profitable. The difficulties of Persius, too, have the
advantage ol being definite and unmistakable-like those of Aeschylus,
not like those of Sophocles-difficulties which do not elude the grasp,

but close with it fairly, and even if they should be still unvanquished,
