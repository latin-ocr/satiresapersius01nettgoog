LIFE AND WRlTINGS OF PERSIUS. xxxv

gods themselves might hesitate whether to lpugh or to weep. He has
to write the tragi-comedy of his day, and he writes it in a dialect where
grandiose epic diction and philosophical terminology are strangely
blended with the talk of the forum, the gymnasia, and the barber’s
shop. I suggest this consideration with the more confidence, as I find
it represented to me, and, as it were, forced on me by the example of
a writer oi our own country, perhaps the most remarkable of the pre-
sent time, wh0, though differing as widely from Persius in all his
circumstances as a world-wearied and desponding man of the nine·
teenth century can differ from an enthusiastic and inexperienced youth
os the first, still appears to me to bear a singular resemblance to him in
the whole character of his genius-I mean Mr. Carlyle. If Persius
can take the benefit of this parallel, he may safely plead guilty to the
charge of not having escaped the vice of his age, the passion for
refining still further on Augustan refinements of expression, and lock-
ing up the meaning of a sentence in epigrammatic allusionS, which in
its measure lies at the door even of Tacitus.

Ihave exhausted my time and, I sear, your patience also, when my
subject is still sar from exhausted. Iam glad, however, to think that
in closing Ι am not really bringing it to an end, but that some of my
hearers to·day will accompany me to-morrow and on future days in

the special study of one who, like all great authors, will surrender the
lull knowledge of his beauties only to those who ask it of him in
detail.
