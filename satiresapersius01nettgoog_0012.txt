PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION

BY THE EDITOR

...00—

F OR the third edition oi this volume the text and commen-
tary have been revised. In place ol the notes from the Gale
manuscript, formerly printed at the foot of the page, Ι have
inserted the apparatus criticus ol Jahn's edition (1868) as re·
vised and reprinted by Bucheler in 1886. In explanation ol
the apparatus 1 have added a few words on the text ol Persius
(pp. xxxvii and xxxviii).

1 have carefully studied the ancient scholia, and especially
the selection from them printed by Bucheler at the foot of his

text (1886). In the general study of Persius’ age and

surroundings, 1 have derived invaluable assistance from Pro-
fessor J. E. Β. Mayor's recent edition of Juvenal, as well as
from Friedl'ander’s editions of Martial and Petronius’ Cena Tri-
malchz'om's. 1 wish also to express my obligation to Pro-
fessor Gildersleeve's edition (New York‚ Harper,187 5), and also
to three short treatises dealing especially with Persius. These
are, (1) by Dr. J. Bieger, De Auli Persii Codice Pz'tlzoeano C
recte aestimando, Berlin, 1890 3 (2) by Dr. J. van Wageningen,
Persiana, Groningen, 1891 3 (3) by Dr. J. H. Ovink, Adversaria
ad Persii Prologum et Satiram Primam, Leyden,1886. The
