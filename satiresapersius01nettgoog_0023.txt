are at any rate palpably felt and appreciated. At the same time he
presents many salient points to the general student of literature; his
individual characteristics as a writer are sufficiently prominent to strike
the most careless eye; his philosophical creed, ardently embraced and
realized with more or less distinctness, is that which proved itself most
congenial to the best parts of the Roman mind, the Stoicism of the
empire3 while his profession of authorship, as avowed by himself,
associates him not only with Horace, but with the less known name of
Lucilius, and the original conception of Roman satire.

The inlonnation which we possess concerning the personal history
ol Persius is more copious than might have been expected in the case
of one whose lite was so short and so uneventlul. His writings,

indeed, cannot be compared with the ‘votive tablets' on which his two ’

great predecessors delighted to inscribe their own memoirs: on the
contrary, except in one famous passage, the autobiographical clement
is scarcely brought forward at all. We see his character written
legibly enough in every line, and there are various minute traces of
experience with which the facts of his life, when ascertained, are per-
ceived to accord; but no one could have attempted to construet his
biography from his Satires without passing even those extended limits
within which modern criticism is pleased to expatiate. But there is a
memoir¹, much more full than most of the biographical notices of that
period, and apparently quite authentic‚ the authorship of which, after
being variously assigned to his instructor and literary executor Comu-

· tus, and to Suetonius, is now generally tired, agreeably to the testimony

of the best MSS, on Valerius Probus, the celebrated contemporary
grammarian, from whose commentary, doubtless an exposition of the
Satires, it is stated to have been extracted. Something has still been
left to the ingenuity or research of later times to supply, in the way of '
conjectural correction or illustration, and in this work no one has been
more diligent than Otto Jahn, to whomPersius is probably more in-
debted than to any other editor, with the single exception of Casaubon.
1 have, myself‚ found his commentary quite invaluable while preparing
my own notes and 1 shall have to draw frequently upon his Prolego·
mena in the course of the present lecture.

Aulus Persius Flaccus was born on the 4th of December, nu. 34,
little more thau two years before the death of Tiberius, at Volaterrae
in Etmria, a country where antiquity of descent was most carefully
cherished, and which had recently produced two men well known in
