LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PERSIUS. xxxi

Lucilius. On the ethical side we should have been hardly prepared to
expect much similarity: there is, however, a curious fragment of
Lucilius, the longest of all that have corne down to us, containinga
simple recital 01 the various constituents 01 virtue, the knowledge 01
duty no less than its practice, in itself sufficiently resembling the

' enumeration 011110 elementa of morality which Persius makes on more
than one occasion, andshowing a turn for doctrinal exposition which
was sure to be appreciated by a pupil 01 the Stoics. So there are ,not
wanting indications that the bold metaphors and grotesque yet forcible
imagery which stamp the character 01 Persius’ style so rnarlredly may
have been encouraged if not suggested by hints in Lucilius, who was
fond 01 tentative experimenta in language, such as belong to the early
stages of poetry‚ when the national taste is in a state of fusion. The .
admitted contrast between the two men, unlilre in all but their equestrian
descent,-between the premature man of the world and the young
philosopher, the improvisatore who could throw 011 two hundred verses
in an hour, and the student who wrote seldom and slowly,-may
warrant us in doubting the success of the imitation, but does not dis·
credit the fact. Our point is, that Persius attempted to wear the toga
01 his predecessor, not that it fitted him.

The influence of Horace upon Persius is a topic which has, in part,
been anticipated already ¹. lt is a patent fact which may be safely
assumed, and l have naturally been led to assume it as a help towards
estimating other things which are not so easily ascertainable. Casaubon
was, I believe, the first to bring it forward prominently into light in an
appendix to his memorable edition 01 Persius; and though one 01 the
later commentators has endeavoured to 0311 11 111 question, cautioning
us against mistalring slight coincidences for palpable imitations, 1 am
confident that a careful and minute study of Persius, such as l have
lately been engaged in, will 110 found only to produce a more complete
conviction 01 113 truth: nor canl doubt that an equally careful perusal
of Horace, line by line and word by word, would enable us to add
still further to the amount 01 proof. Yet it is curious and instructive
to observe that it is a point which, while established by a superabund-
ance of the best possible evidence, that 01 ocular demonstration, is yet
singularly deficient in those minor elements 01 probability to which we
